NotMiss is a <strong>PWA (Progressive Web App)</strong> conceived by <b>Renato Esposito</b> and <b>Luca Rubino</b> for a university project of <a href="https://www.uniparthenope.it/ugov/degreecourse/43358"><i><b>Web Technologies</i>(TW6)</b></a> of the <b><i><a href="https://www.uniparthenope.it/">Parthenope University of Naples</a></i><b>.

<br><br><br>

<h3><i>Goals</i></h3>

◉ The idea is to offer a platform for the management and organization of events.

◉ Currently some social networks offer the functionality of creating events, but it is in fact a basic secondary functionality.

◉ We also want to respect the privacy of those who use NotMiss by giving users the possibility of not necessarily sharing personal information on the platform (this is not currently possible with social networks).

◉ NotMiss aims to be a PWA entirely dedicated to the concept of a 360 ° event.


<h3><i>Functionality</i></h3>

<h4>The NotMiss PWA offers the possibily:</h4>

◉ to create events with extensive customization.

◉ to create a friendList with which you can share your private events.

◉ to make the events public in a bulletin board visible to all NotMiss users.

◉ to review the creator of an event, so that other users can evaluate its reliability.
